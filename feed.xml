While this is tongue-in-cheek, it has seeds of truth. Have you ever started working
on a bug or feature and thought 'I'll just keep everything in my head' or 'I'll
remember the important parts as I go'? That's hubris. According to Debugging
with the Scientific Method no matter how smart you think
you are, write things down.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://jmckitrick.github.io/posts-output/2020-05-12-why-matters/</guid><link>http://jmckitrick.github.io/posts-output/2020-05-12-why-matters/</link><title>Why personal process matters</title><description>When I've asked colleagues about their 'personal process', I'm surprised how many give me a blank stare
and say 'I don't really have one.' This isn't all that surprising. Programmers are often known for not
liking process, especially anything imposed on them by management.But at the same time, programmers often consider their job a craft, maybe even more art than science.
If that's the case, then we need to take responsibility for our own growth, both within our current
organization and outside it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://jmckitrick.github.io/posts-output/2020-05-11-first-post/</guid><link>http://jmckitrick.github.io/posts-output/2020-05-11-first-post/</link><title>First post</title><description>I've been kicking around the idea of starting a blog for some time now.
I'm hoping to share some random ramblings here, partly to share my
observations and partly just to record them.Topics</description><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
